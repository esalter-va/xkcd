# XKCD

A simple iOS app for viewing the latest XKCD comics.  Currently a work in progress.

## About the project

I couldn't find an xkcd reader on the App Store that I liked, so I decided to make one.  In keeping with the open nature of Randall's comic, I decided to make it open source and free with no advertising.  The project is currently a WIP, but once it is completed, I will publish it on the app store.  Feel free to take any of my code/fork the project.  If you have any requests, let me know.  I may be able to do it for you.  Any suggestions and comments are appreciated!
